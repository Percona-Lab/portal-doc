## Enhancements

**At-a-glace overview of Percona entitlements** 

If you are a member of a customer organization, you can now check the entitlements for your account on the **Dashboard** tab.

## Fixed issue
[SAAS-782](https://jira.percona.com/browse/SAAS-782) - Clicking on **View Organization** in the **Dashboard** page now opens the organization details in the current tab instead of opening a separate one. 

## Known issue

[PMM-9255](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9255): After connecting to Percona Platform, PMM occasionally shows a false pemission issue notification, incorrectly suggesting that the connection could not be established due to missing permissions. 

Reload the page in PMM to remove the incorrect notification and confirm the connection.
