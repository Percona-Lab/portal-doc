Create an organization to collaborate with members of your team and share access to the software and services available for your Percona Platform account. <br />
Organizations are linked to Percona Accounts. Each Percona Account gives access to only one organization. <br />
This means that you cannot be member of multiple organizations or create more than one organization for your Percona Account. 

###To create an organization: 

1. Log in to [Percona Platform](https://portal.percona.com/percona) using your Percona Account.
2. On the **Getting Started** page, click **Add Organization**. <br />
Existing Percona Support customers and Percona Accounts that are already associated with an organization will see an option to view their existing organization instead. 
3. Enter a relevant name for your new organization, then click **Save**. <br />
This creates the new organization and displays its general details like name and creation date.


###Existing organizations for Percona customers
If you are an existing Percona Support customer, you do not need to manually create or join organizations. Percona Platform can recreate existing Percona Customer organizations based on the details available on the Percona Customer account.<br />
The organization is automatically recreated the first time that the Customer Portal account administrator logs into the Platform. <br />
Other organization members subsequently logging in to the Platform will be automatically added as members of the existing organization. <br /><br />

All the information about the organization like available Support entitlements, tickets, and contacts is also automatically copied over to your new Platform organization. <br />
As an account administrator, finish setting up the recreated organization by making sure all your organization members register for a Percona Account and log in to the Portal. <br />
This ensures that your new Platform organization mirrors the hierarchy of your organization on Customer Portal. 

###Viewing the organization info

After creating or joining an organization, you can check its details at any time:

1. Go toÂ **Getting Started** tab. Notice that the option to create the organization is now checked. 
2. Click **View Organization** to manage your organization and check its details.



##Roles and permissions
When you create an organization, you are automatically assigned the role of Admin for that organization. <br />
You can add people to your organization as **Admins** or **Technical users**. Here are the different permissions available for these roles:<br />

| Permission      | Admin user |  Technical user
| ----------| ----------- |----------- |
|View users and organization|:heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark:|

###Add organization members

Administrators can add any number of Technical users to the organization and even add other Admins if necessary. <br />
To add a user to your organization:
1. Log in to Percona Platform Portal.
2. Click **View Organization** on the **Getting Started** page. 
3. On the **Members** tab, click the **Invite Member** button. 
4. Enter your team member's corporate email address and select a role.
5. Click **Save** to send the invitation to join your organization. 


##Edit roles<br />
Currently, organization users cannot change their own role. However, Administrators can change the user role for all the other members in their organization. <br />
To do so:

1. Go to **Getting Started > View Organization**. 
2. Open the **Members** tab.
3. In the **Actions** column, click on the **Edit** icon next to the user whose role you want to change.
This displays the **Edit Member** form.
4. In the **Role** field, select the new role that you want to assign to the user and click **Save**.
